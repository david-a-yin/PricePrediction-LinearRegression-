# PricePrediction-LinearRegression

Project for the University of Texas - Data Science and Business Analytics certification course

Employed a linear regression model for predicting the price of used cell phones and tablets and identifying the significant factors affecting their pricing. This information is valuable for sellers, buyers, and market analysts, as it allows for informed pricing decisions, negotiation strategies, and market trend analysis.
